# Project plan

## Start-up phase

<!--
Covering the planning phase, this section should provide a relatively detailed plan of how work will start on the project. This section is important because projects need to get up and running quickly.


 - [ ] Setting up collaboration platform inc. code for contributors etc.
 - [ ] Licence decisions
 - [ ] Reporting framework
-->

A GitHub repository will be set up for us to collaboratively work on documents
summarising our evaluation of the different systems. The identified CMS software
will be ordered to prioritise most likely candidates first in case evaluation 
takes longer than expected.

## Technical delivery
<!--
Covering the actual delivery of the project this section should provide at least a high-level the implementation. 

Including target dates is really important as you need to be committed and the ISC need to have a means of tracking delivery
-->

### Evaluation Stage (Mid March - End April)

We will work through each CMS in turn, with the proposers performing the 
following roles

 - Locke Data: Set up test system, if time allows consider general issues such 
 as security, accessibility, ability to set up recurring events and handle 
 multiple conferences
 - Full team: Rotate through the following roles and collaboratively edit
 document on pros/cons of system
    - Participant 1: submit abstract, edit abstract, contact local organizer
    - Participant 2: submit abstract, register (no payment - or pay nominal 
    amount and refund?)
    - Program chair: assign abstracts to reviewers, make final decision, 
    schedule presentations, assign chairs
    - Reviewer 1: ask for first abstract to be reassigned (to Reviewer 2), 
    review second abstract, make recommendation
    - Reviewer 2: review first abstract, make recommendation, suggest session 
    for abstract, see if there is a way to group with second abstract
    - Local organizer - email registered participants, add information to the
    conference website
    
After evaluating the last CMS, Locke Data will round up the pros/cons of each CMS, 
make further tests as requested by the team and consider additional pros/cons 
not explicitly tested by the above.

At the end of this stage the team will meet to discuss the pros and cons and 
make a decision on which CMS to take forward. Some queries may need to be 
followed up by Locke Data before a final decision is made.

Estimated work time:

 - Steph: 20 days
 - Others: 10 hours each

### Development Stage (May - June)

Having decided on a CMS, Locke Data will work on putting the system into production, ready for use by useR! 2018 and the next satRdays. This will include creating standard text where possible e.g. for abstract submission instructions, and creating templates that reuse parameters, e.g. abstract submission deadlines.

Given previous experience of testing each CMS, the team will decide how best to test the system. A certain amount of testing will be done by each team member. Members of the community may be invited to comment on the website and to test the system, in particular this may be necessary to fully test accessibility for the visually impaired.

Locke Data will make adjustments in response to the testing. Larger changes - requiring extensions to the system itself - may need to be addressed in a separate project.

Estimated work time:

 - Locke Data: 18 days
 - Others: 8 hours each

### Production Stage (July - )

Locke Data will work with the organisers of useR! 2018 and the next satRdays to 
provide support in using the new system and make any necessary adjustments.

Estimated work time:

 - Locke Data: 5 days
