# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->
The project will deliver a new conference management system for R Consortium supported conferences.

## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->
The milestones for the project are 

  1. Evaluate candidate CMS software and select the best one to take forward.
  2. Set up the chosen CMS ready for use by useR! and satRdays.
  3. Handover to the organizers of useR! and satRdays.

## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->
If deficiencies in the selected CMS are identified, further development of the 
CMS itself may be desirable to fill this gap. Alternatively, integration with 
other services, for example for personalised schedules, could be explored.

Although the system will have been extensively tested during evaluation and 
development, no doubt some issues will arise during the first useR! and 
satRdays using the system and there would be ongoing maintenance of the system,
which hopefully could be handled by the conference organizers.

## Key risks

Locke Data will be responsible for the successful delivery of this project. Locke Data anticipate using freelancers on a third of the work for the project. If more work needs to be done by freelancers, then the time to recruit people could cause delays.

It is possible that some obstacle would be meet in attempting to set up a 
particular CMS. If this could not be overcome, this would simply eliminate the
CMS from the evaluation. Since we have a good set of candidates, we are 
confident that at least one can be selected as suitable CMS for useR! and
satRdays, even if it does not implement everything on our wish list.

The main cost is associated with the time setting up each CMS and developing the
selected CMS. We would prioritise the four candidates, so that if the evaluation 
phase took longer than expected, we could consider at least three candidates. If 
the development phase takes longer than expected this could run into the 
handover time, if necessary passing some of the set up cost onto organizers of
the next useR! and satRdays. The proposed timeline aims to handover in July, 
when useR! 2017 will only just have taken place. Thus a delay of one or even two 
months could be accommodated with minimal effect on the organisation of the
next conference.
