# Requirements
<!-- 
An idea of what is required to make the project actually happen
-->

## People
<!--
Who needs to be involved, what's the proposed structure, what will it take to get their involvement?
-->
Locke Data Ltd will take on the technical work. Locke Data's primary lead for this work will be Steph Locke. Steph is a founder of
satRdays and managed the centralized infrastructure since its inception. Locke Data anticipates using freelancers and sub-contractors for some of the work where it is outside of Steph's skillset.

The core evaluation team will consist of useR! and R Foundation personnel. Heather Turner and Julie Josse have both been local organizers and program chairs of useR!. Balasubramanian Narasimhan was chair of the local organizing committee for useR! 2016. Torben Tvedebrink was local organizer of useR! 2015 and managed the development of the abstract handling software used in 2015 and 2016. Torsten Hothorn and Achim Zeileis are the permanent members of the R Foundation Conference Committee and founders of useR!.

Additional members of the community may be consulted for further testing and advice.

## Processes
<!-- 
What processes need to be put in place e.g. codes of conduct, regular ISC meetings, handover to the community at large?
-->
A contributor code of conduct will be adopted to govern the work of the team and
future work on the CMS.

Any development of the CMS itself will be contributed back to the open source 
project for all to use. Development of content specific to the useR! or satRdays
conferences will be owned by the Consortium for the purpose of running and 
maintaining the CMS.

ISC members would be invited to join review meetings during the evaluation and 
development stages.

## Tools & Tech
<!--
What is going to be needed to deliver this project? 

Will cloud computing be used - if yes are there are necessary components that will be deciding factors between providers?

Are there tools or tech that don't exist that will be produced to facilitate the project?
-->
We will use a public GitHub for team collaboration. All the candidate CMS are
open source and free to use.

The test, development, and productions systems will require hosting on a 
dedicated virtual machine (running Debian, with backup and cloning) 
in a secure environment. The scale will vary through the project according to 
the number of people accessing the system and the amount of content added to the
system. 

## Funding
<!--
A summary of the requirements that contextualises the costs
-->

The main cost is for the development work associated with CMS evaluation and deployment, that will be conducted by Locke Data. This work is broken down into milestones, reflecting the project stages outlined in the Technical Delivery section. The hourly rate of $100, used in previous R Consortium sponsored projects such as R-Hub, has been used to arrive at costs. 

The hosting cost is anticipated to be around $500 to have multiple CMS systems 
running for evaluation purposes. The ongoing hosting costs are not covered here, we assume they will be accounted for in the conference budgets.

The R Consortium have offered part-funding of USD 19,000 for this project, which is subtracted from the costs to leave USD 13,000 which we request the R Foundation to fund.

| Item | Cost (USD) |
| ---- | ----:|
| Milestone 1: Evaluation of CMS | 15,000  |
| Milestone 2: Development of CMS | 12,750 |
| Milestone 3: Handover to useR!/satRdays | 3,750 |
| Project Hosting | 500 |
| R Consortium Funding| -19,000 |
| **Total** | **13,000** |
