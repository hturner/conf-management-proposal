# The Proposal

Our proposal is to evaluate a number of open source CMS to assess their 
suitability for use with useR! and satRdays, then to select and deploy a CMS in 
time for useR! 2018 and the next satRday.

We have identified the following CMS software that appear to meet most, 
if not all, of our essential requirements:

 - [Open Conference Systems (OCS)](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ocs/)
 - [Indico](http://indico-software.org/)
 - [frab](https://frab.github.io/frab/)
 - [Open Source Event Manager (osem)](https://github.com/openSUSE/osem)
 
We will set up test installations of these systems to evaluate their 
functionality and ease of use for all roles (systems administrator, 
local organizer, program chair, reviewer, conference participant). The features
we are looking for in a CMS are listed below, with essential features 
marked by an asterisk.

### Software

 - Open source*
 - Actively maintained*
 - Well documented
 - Extensible by proposal participants
 - Integrates with third party payment providers to avoid PCI-DSS*
 - Conferences only incur hosting costs if they run it themselves

### Abstract management

 - Handles abstract submission, with email notification*
 - Allows markdown in abstracts
 - Allows submitters to edit abstracts
 - Abstracts can be assigned to reviewers automatically (e.g. by topic) and/or
 manually*
 - Allows custom review decisions
 - Handles special submissions, e.g. scholarship applications

### Scheduling

 - Tools to create conference schedule*
 - Drag-and-drop scheduling
 - Conflict management (of topics or people)
 - Tools for assigning chairs to sessions
 - Tools for chairs to communicate with session participants,
 regarding slides, schedule changes
 - Tools to obtain video recording permission or permission to
 distribute slides
 - Tools for assigning poster slots and identifiers
 - Tools for taking room capacities into account

### Participant management

 - Register participants, including accepting payments*
 - Participant accounts to make it easy to participate in multiple conferences
 - Ability to email all participants
 - Letter generation facility to request visa for international participants
 - Personal schedules or integration with services such as
 [Conference4me](http://conference4me.psnc.pl/).

### Conference management

 - Template for conference website, suitable for different devices, secure and
 accessible to visually impaired*
 - Hosting of presentation slides
 - Ability to clone conference for recurring event
 - Ability to poll participants on conference issues

### Other benefits

Each system will likely have other non-essential benefits, e.g. event evaluation
surveys, automated email reminders, time zone support, etc that could also be
taken into account when comparing systems.
