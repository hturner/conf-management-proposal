# The Problem
<!-- 
Outlining the issue / weak point / problem to be solved by this proposal. This should be a compelling section that sets the reader up for the next section - the proposed solution!

It is important to cover:

 - [ ] What the problem is
 - [ ] Who it affects
 - [ ] Have there been previous attempts to resolve the problem
 - [ ] Why it should be tackled

The useR! conference has been successfully managed for over a decade by local
organizers. Although knowledge and code is passed on from one year to the next,
each time the local organizers set up a new website, on a new domain, and set 
up their own way to manage abstract submissions, participant registration and
conference organization. This means each year a lot of effort, volunteer or paid
out of the conference budget, is spent on setting up the conference management 
system. Participants often have to adjust to a new interface and may find it 
difficult to find information or use the system. Issues identified one year may 
never be fixed, or their solutions may not be carried through to the next year.

The handling and reviewing of abstracts has been dealt with separately. 
Solutions for doing this include using Google Sheets to assign reviewers and
allocate ratings, and using a system built by the organizers of useR! 2015 to
allow reviewers to view each abstract and add comments. As the number of 
submissions grows (~350 abstracts for useR! 2016) a more sophisticated system
is needed to allocate reviewers and record reviews.

Establishing a centralized conference management system would allow a 
fully-featured conference management system to be developed, with consistency 
from one year to the next. This would reduce the burden on local organisers
and pave the way for future developments of useR!, such as more centralized/
outsourced administration, or satellite conferences.

Recently the R Consortium supported the creation of the new satRdays conference
series. In this case centralized conference management was an objective from the
start. However, fitting in unpaid work on the infrastructure proved difficult.

As both R Consortium supported conferences have a need for the development of
a conference management system we have joined forces on this proposal.

We see this as a first step in increasing collaboration between groups, and look forward to further work together.
